# GHCN Tool
Exploration and extraction of daily GHCN climatological data (Global Historical Climatologic Network) https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnd-data-access

The first notebook allows to view the stations list in a single browser (station, country, period by parameter), and to apply filter (e.g. selecting country and/or stations). A graph is plotted representing the number of stations for each year, and a map is displayed to show the station locations. Outputs can be saved in an excel file.

A second notebook also allows daily time series to be extracted and montly aggregated.
